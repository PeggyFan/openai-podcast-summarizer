From Marketplace, I'm Sabri Benishor in for David Bruncaccio. Later this morning we will hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He's kicking off the first full day of the Fed's economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It is a conference that offers a look at the big picture issues in economics the Federal Reserve is thinking about, and Powell's speech could move markets like it did last year. Marketplace's Nancy Marshall Genzer has more. The theme at Jackson Hole this year is structural shifts in the global economy, with discussions on how the pandemic and central banks' response to it changed the economy. Investors will weigh every word of Powell's speech this morning, looking for clues on whether the Fed will keep raising interest rates when it meets next month. Powell spooked investors with his speech last year. He warned of higher interest rates and pain. Fed watchers aren't predicting such strong signals from Powell this year. The inflation rate has been falling, but don't expect Powell to take a victory lap. Instead, he's expected to talk about how the Fed's inflation fight isn't over. The central bank raises rates to make it harder to borrow and spend in an effort to cool the economy. Powell is expected to say the Fed will be data-dependent as it weighs its next move. The Personal Consumption Expenditure's price index, one of Powell's favorite inflation gauges, comes out this Thursday, and the Labor Department is scheduled to release the August unemployment rate a week from today. I'm Nancy Marshall-Genser for Marketplace. The European Union's Digital Services Act comes into force today, and some of the world's tech giants like Google, Facebook, and TikTok will be directly affected. They'll be hit with brand new rules on content moderation, user privacy, transparency. The BBC's Alex Bell has more. The new rules are aimed at big players, including Facebook, Instagram, Apple's App Store, and TikTok, which have all been told to shield users from dangerous content and be more open about privacy and data. For now, only platforms with more than 45 million users are being asked to make changes, but from early 2024, the rules will apply to all operating in Europe. Non-compliance could cost operators up to 6% of global turnover, with repeat offenders facing a ban from European markets altogether. While some have embraced the changes, others, including Amazon, have disagreed with how the rules are being applied. It comes at a time of increased scrutiny on online platforms, with mounting pressure on companies to keep their users safe. I'm the BBC's Alex Bell for Marketplace. All right, let's do the numbers. Dow, S&P, and NASDAQ futures are all up in the 0.1% to 0.3% range, with the Dow future up 107 points. The yield on the 10-year treasury is 4.239%. Maui County is suing utility Hawaiian Electric. It's accusing the company of failing to shut down its power lines and causing deadly wildfires that the county says were preventable. The power company says it needed to keep the electricity on to power water pumps and medical equipment. The Maui fires took the lives of 115 people and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damages. People like to say that money can't buy you happiness, and I think they're wrong. Sort of. I'm Giannelli Espinal, host of Financially Inclined from Marketplace, a new podcast that's all about money lessons you probably never learned, until now. From credit cards to buying a car and all the big feelings in between, Financially Inclined is all about money lessons for living life your own way. Listen to Financially Inclined wherever you get your podcasts. Last week, U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum said it would pay more than a billion dollars for a company that works on capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This technology is called Direct Air Capture, and it is seen as a promising solution for fighting climate change by both U.S. government and industry. For more on this, we've got Vijay Vaitheeswaran, Global Energy and Climate Innovation Editor at The Economist magazine. Hi, Vijay. Hi, there. Nice to be with you again. Same. So, just to start, can you briefly explain how this technology works? So it's like a vacuum cleaner, basically, that just sucks carbon out of the air? You know, that's actually as good a description as anyone's come up for it. In effect, the carbon dioxide that's in the air is very dispersed. It's hard to capture. But we have come up with a few technologies that can suck it out of the air using chemicals. And then you can store it in the ground permanently, which would be the ideal solution. Or maybe you can use it to make fizzy drinks or other industrial purposes. So the firm that Occidental is acquiring is called Carbon Engineering. And apparently you actually visited one of their pilot projects some time back. What did that look like? Yeah. Carbon Engineering is a really interesting company. It's backed by Bill Gates and has been for a while. I've been tracking this for over 15 years. And I went up to a place outside of Vancouver where they have a pilot plant that they've been working on for a number of years. Based on that, they were able to get a billion dollar project approval in which Occidental, the big American oil company in which Warren Buffett has an investment, has decided to support them scaling this up in Texas. That's the launch of a project that I attended in a place called No Trees, Texas, in the Permian Basin where America's oil patches. Can you give us a sense of the scale of investment both by the federal government and the private sector into this particular technology? Yeah. First, just to give a sense of perspective here. This is one tool in the toolkit. Nobody suggests that direct air capture will solve our climate change problem. And it's ridiculous to think that. On the other hand, the UN scientific experts at the Intergovernmental Panel, IPCC, they argue that we need negative emissions technologies by 2050 if we're going to deal with the century's climate problems. A couple of streams of revenue have come into this. One of them, of course, is startup capital. But we have big money coming in from the oil industry. But the US government has just given a massive grant, $1.2 billion for specifically this topic. So real money going into pilot phase projects that are ready to scale up to commercial level. This technology has gotten some criticism. Environmentalists who criticize Occidental and other oil companies for investing in this basically saying it's just an excuse for them to keep on pumping oil. Are those fair? It's only right to be skeptical when an oil company says, hey, we're going to do this nice thing and so we can keep pumping oil by all means. However, the problem we have with climate change is so enormous that just having lots more windmills and Teslas might make us feel good, but it isn't enough to solve the problem. And so I think there is proper scientific ground to say, whoever wants to invest in this, let's welcome the investment. Vijay Vathiswaran is Global Energy and Climate Innovation Editor at The Economist magazine. Vijay, thank you so much. It's been a great pleasure. In New York, I'm Sabri Beneshor with the Marketplace Morning Report."},
