I'm David Brancaccio in New York. Apple's expected to unveil its latest iPhone on Tuesday and some industry observers expect some models to be priced perhaps $100 higher. Separately, China is reportedly banning iPhones for government officials. The move comes as China's own smartphone maker, Huawei, makes progress in matching advanced Western chip technology. Marketplace's Nova Sapo has more. Neither Apple nor the US government is commenting on a Wall Street Journal report that China is barring central government officials from using iPhones or other foreign branded devices. It's unclear how wide ranging the reported ban is. China is an important growth market for smartphone makers. In Apple's last quarter, it accounted for the highest rate of sales growth, 8% year over year. But China and the US are engaged in tit for tat trade sanctions. Back to back visits this summer from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have done little to thaw relations. And Apple, which is expected to unveil its newest iPhone next week amid flagging smartphone sales, is caught in the middle. I'm Nova Sapo for Marketplace. And I'm Europe's host. We've been keeping an eye on how U.S. cities have been recovering economically from deep pandemic. This week our newsroom partners at the BBC are taking a global look. India has abundant tech talent, but job opportunities are often concentrated in key cities. This has led to millions moving to cities over the last three decades, but the pandemic and air pollution have driven many workers back to their villages. One successful software firm is playing to that by building offices in the most remote corners of the country. The BBC's Nikhil Inamdar filed this report for us. Milking her cows at the crack of dawn. This is Santhia's daily routine before she goes to train as a tech professional at Soho. It's a $5 billion technology enterprise that's brought skilled tech jobs to her rural hamlet in southern India's Tamil Nadu state. My parents would not have allowed me to go to a big city to study or work, but now because this company has come here, I can do a job. Vignesh who's been working for Soho for the past decade left the big city of Chennai six years ago and came back to his village when Soho set up shop. Living here allows Vignesh to follow his other big passion while doing his day job as a busy techie, cultivating a forest. Working here allows me to live near my parents. The weather is much nicer and I'm close to nature. I can do things like creating this forest. India's big cities are choking with traffic and pollution. Indians spent precious hours of their day in long commutes. But here at Soho's village office, literally in the middle of nowhere, hundreds of engineers are working to build world-class software. The company believes you don't need to be in the big city to do that. And its rural offices are an experiment that hope to address many problems. De-congesting the big cities, halting brain drain from the villages and bringing about a rural revival. I'm at the Soho village office in Tinkasi and it hardly looks like the office space of a typical software company. Instead of the glass and steel fa\u00e7ade, here's this building with big wooden Chettinad pillars, a traditional sloping roof and surrounded by lush paddy fields and mountains. To tell you the truth, it's quite strange to see 750 young techies coding and designing in this environment. There are multiple ways in which the companies benefited from this model. There's complete parity on how much we pay a developer or a programmer. Soho now wants to create a hundred such village offices across the world, says Praval Singh, its head of marketing. We are able to retain people for longer terms and I think that's the biggest value add for a company like us which looks at it long term. We've always had attrition numbers in single digits essentially, it's always been less than 10. The local economy of this region has boomed as well after Soho came. A funky cafe made with containers close to Soho's office is introducing global cuisine to the region \u2013 pizzas, burgers, milkshakes. It gets 70% of its business from Soho employees. But is living in the village really good for your career? I asked Shiv Agarwal, a recruiter who places thousands of white collar workers into companies every year. You probably end up having a better quality of life personally, but that comes at a price. There are many push factors that push us towards looking at urban areas. For one, just more opportunity, the ability to network, higher pay. So a lot of that ends up pushing us towards moving out of villages into big cities. The quiet stillness of the evening at this rural campus, away from the bustle of the big city, is not for everyone. But 1 in 10 Indians who moved to the village during the pandemic have not returned to the big city. Local offices like Soho's will only enable more to make that choice. In Tenkasi, India, I'm the BBC's Nikhil Anandar for Marketplace. In New York, you're listening to the Marketplace Morning Report. We're from APM, American Public Media. When it comes to the climate crisis, does what you wear really matter? What about the food in your fridge? Should climate activists move beyond peaceful protest? How We Survive, a podcast from Marketplace, presents a new mini-series called Burning Questions. Each episode, we're diving into a pressing climate concern to find out how our individual and collective choices can impact the world.
